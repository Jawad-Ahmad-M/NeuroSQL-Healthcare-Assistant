## Introduction
In the era of data-driven decision-making, the ability to extract meaningful insights from vast datasets is paramount. NeuroSQL addresses the challenges faced by users who may lack extensive SQL knowledge but require access to data for analysis and reporting. By leveraging state-of-the-art NLP techniques, NeuroSQL translates user-friendly queries into precise SQL commands, ensuring that users can focus on deriving insights rather than struggling with query syntax.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing:** Interpret plain-language user queries using NLP algorithms.
- **Multi-Database Support:** Works with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.
- **Schema-Aware Suggestions:** Generates optimized, contextually accurate SQL based on your DB schema.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for both technical and non-technical users.
- **Error Reduction:** Validates and parses queries intelligently to reduce mistakes.

## Architecture
NeuroSQL is built using a modular architecture with the following components:
1. **Input Processing Module:** Preprocesses natural language queries.
2. **NLU Module:** Uses ML models to detect intent and map to database schema.
3. **SQL Generation Module:** Produces optimized SQL queries from interpreted data.
4. **Output Display Module:** Presents the SQL query with context or suggestions.

## Installation

    Example:
    ```text
    Show me the total number of patients admitted last month.
    ```
3. **View the SQL Output**
    Example output:
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM patients 
    WHERE admission_date BETWEEN '2023-09-01' AND '2023-09-30';
    ```

## Examples
**Query:** List all doctors in the cardiology department.
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM doctors 
WHERE department = 'Cardiology';
```

**Query:** What are the top 5 most common diagnoses in the last year?
```sql
SELECT diagnosis, COUNT(*) AS count 
FROM patient_records 
WHERE admission_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR) 
GROUP BY diagnosis 
ORDER BY count DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

**Query:** Get the average length of stay for patients in ICU.
```sql
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(discharge_date, admission_date)) AS average_length_of_stay 
FROM patient_records 
WHERE department = 'ICU';
```
